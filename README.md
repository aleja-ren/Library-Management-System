# Library-Management-System
This project is a Java application for managing a library. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where the main class Main initializes key components to handle the library model and the user interface.
## Description
The application manages library data, including functions to display and manipulate book information.
The Main.java file serves as the entry point, initializing the Library model and the ViewManager for the interface.
The repository includes a PDF with a protoype and a small file with some books.

## Structure:
- Main.java: Main class that starts the application, initializing the model and view components.
- Library: Model that represents and manages library data.
- ViewManager: Interface component that interacts with the user to display and modify the model’s data.

## Usage

Feel free to clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aleja-ren/Library-Management-System.git
```
Compile and run the Main.java file from your preferred Java development environment.
